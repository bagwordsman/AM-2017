/*
Basic Stylesheet
 - all css for any page of the Able Mediation Website
 - could load page specific css by cutting out what isn't required

 NOTES:
 - reset currently in style.css (required by WordPress, in root of theme)
 - import priorities: 1 - variables, 2 - home page and top of pages, 3 - components

 TESTING:
 - by changing output css in AM-css-js.php
 - may have to experiment with ordering of the cascade
